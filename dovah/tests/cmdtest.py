# This line does NOT work; when it's uncommented, it enables intellisense on the term command_maker:
#from ..dovah_cli import commandmaker as command_maker

class CmdTest:
    #def run(command_maker):
    def run():
        #does not take a parameter
        CmdTest.toggle_commands()
        #takes a target
        CmdTest.targeted_commands()
        #takes arguments but no target
        CmdTest.untargeted_commands()

        pass







    def targeted_commands():
